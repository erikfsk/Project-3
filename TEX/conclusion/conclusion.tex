Both numerical methods has been tested and the Verlet-Velocity method comes out as the best. The time is nearly the same, but the Verlet-Velocity conserves energies, momentum and angular momentum for the earth-sun system. After these different scenarios has been studied with mostly expected results. The most unexpected result was with the three body system when Jupiter had the same mass as the sun. Here the Verlet-Velocity method struggle to produce reasonable results. The relativistic effect on mercury was studied and we are happy to report that our results correspond to observed values\cite{project3}.

Future work should aim to get an adaptive step size for the solver. This would probably help the three-body system. It would also be nice if a simple interface was developed, so we dont need to hard code each test.
