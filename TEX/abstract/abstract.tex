In this report we test the Verlet-Velocity method and the Forward-Euler method against each other. Here Verlet-Velocity will come out as a clear winner with an almost equal calculation time as Forward-Euler and with conserved values for kinetic energy, potential energy, momentum and angular momentum. The Verlet-Velocity is then used for calculations of various solar systems. All calculations are done in 3D, but all the figures are made in 2D. This is to maximize the visual quality of the report. The escape velocity is determined analytically and numerical and Jupiters\footnote{Vi er dysletikere og har greid å skrive Jupitur igjennom hele oppgaven. Dette inkluderer alle figurer. Vi oppdaget dette på søndag og vi har dermed ikke tid til å lage figurene på nytt.} mass effect on earth orbit in the three body system is discussed. The Verlet-Velocity fails to produce stable results for this system. The effect of general relativity is confirmed through a simulation of the perihelion precession of Mercury.
