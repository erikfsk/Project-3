For thousand of years humankind have looked up to the beyond and wondered. Specifically our race has wondered about the motion of our solar system. Finally after Newton the mystery was solved. Newton developed the gravitational law, which made it possible to predict the motion of the planets. After a couple of centuries Einstein came with the thoery of general relativity and made a small refinement to the law of motion that Newton proposed.

These laws are not enough to solve the motion of the planets. The laws makes differential equation which are not trivial or even impossible to solve. This is where a our computational physics course comes in.\footnote{\href{http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS3150/h17/index.html}{\color{blue}{Semester page for FYS3150 - Autumn 2017}}.} With the tools developed in this course we can make a prediction to the motion of the planets in our solarsystem. And because of our assignment we kind of have to do this to pass the course.\cite{project3}

In this project we will make an object oriented code to solve the solar system with the Forward Eulers method and the Verlet-Velocity method. Both method will be derived, discussed, implemented and benchmarked for the Earth-Sun system. The Verlet-Velocity proved to be the superior master race of algorithms and was thereby used for further calculations. The Verlet-Velocity method was then used on the three-body system with varying mass and finally for the full solar system.

An analysis on the motion of Mercurys perihelion as part of a two body system with the sun is also conducted. In contrast to the other plantes in the solar system, the precession of Mercurys perihelion can not be explained by classical predictions alone. This proved to be a major thorn in late 19th centurys astrophysicists side as the observational data perplexingly did not match up with, what was considered, the indefectibility of Newtons gravitational law. The historical significance of this phenomenon in adition to its paradigm-dualistic nature makes it particularly interesting. Our experiments show that we get an accurate prediction of the perihelion precession when relativistic effects are considered, which contribute with a missing angular deviation of $\theta$ = $43''$.
