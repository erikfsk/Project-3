For thousand of years humankind have looked up to the beyond and wondered. Specifically our race has wondered about the motion of our solar system. Finally after Newton the mystery was solved. Newton developed the gravitational law, which made it possible to predict the motion of the planets. After a couple of centuries Einstein came with the thoery of general relativity and made a small refinement to the law of motion that Newton proposed.

These laws are not enough to solve the motion of the planets. The laws makes differential equation which are not trivial or even impossible to solve. This is where a our computational physics course comes in \todo{REF KURSETS HJEMMESIDE}. With the tools developed in this course we can make a prediction to the motion of the planets in our solarsystem.

In this project we will make an object oriented code to solve the solar system with Forward Eulers method and Velocity Verlet. Both method will be derived, discussed, implemented and benchmarked for the Earth-Sun system.

Finally, a relativistic correction was made.......
